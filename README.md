# KotlinBaseProject

A base code which I almost use in every project I work on!
It shows how to use ViewModels and Room together with Coroutines & Dagger by Clean Architecture in Kotlin!
This way you don`t need to repeat the same code in different parts of your project over & over.

### Libraries Used
#### if you do need specific library feel fre to delete it from build.gradle.kts 'dependencies' section

### FAQ

#### ü§î What if i need to update library version?

‚òùÔ∏è Before update you should read what new was added, or it can brake your functionality (for android libraries [link](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/versions/all-channel))

### Gradle Kotlin DSL (Domain-specific language) benefits
* statically typed & type-safe DSL
* first-class functions, extension methods
* IDE auto-compete and content assist
* it‚Äôs easier to start doing more complicated things
* the errors are detected by the compiler
* imports added automatically

### Custom Lint Rule
Default set of lint rules is limited and in some situations we could benefit from creating custom rules that identify issues that are specific to our projects.

### Testing
![Testing](test_pyramid.png)
#### So lets get more specific. In android there is 3 kind of tests:

* Unit testing: tests that validate your app‚Äôs behavior one class at a time
* Integration testing: tests that validate either interactions between levels of the stack within a module, or interactions between related modules
* End ‚Äî to end tests: tests that validate user journeys spanning multiple modules of your app
